# Stock Data Visualization with Moving Averages and Candlestick Charts

## Overview
This Python script allows users to fetch stock price data for a given symbol over a specific date range and visualize it using two different methods:
1. **Stock price with Moving Averages**: A line chart showing the stock's closing price along with 50-day and 200-day moving averages.
2. **Candlestick chart**: A detailed candlestick chart displaying the stock's open, high, low, and close prices.

## Requirements
Before running the script, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `yfinance`: For fetching stock price data.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting the line charts.
- `plotly`: For creating interactive candlestick charts.

You can install the required libraries using pip:
